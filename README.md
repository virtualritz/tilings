# Regular- & Semi-Regular Tilings
This crate creates 2D meshes of all of the regular and semi-regular
tilings of the plane.

Ported to Rust from
[Keenan Craneâ€™s code](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/tilings.zip)

A
[regular tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons#Regular_tilings)
is one consisting of only a single regular polygon with unit length
edges.

A
[semi-regular tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons#Archimedean,_uniform_or_semiregular_tilings)
may contain more than one type of polygon, but each vertex will
look identical (up to rotation).
